#bootstrap create-react-app and electron and three.js

This is a fork of [electron-with-create-react-app](https://github.com/csepulv/electron-with-create-react-app).  In this fork, I am integrating three.js in the form of [react-three-renderer-example](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer-example).

I have removed some of the examples from the original `react-three-renderer-example`, to simplify things a bit.

To run the application:

    npm install
    npm start

## from the original README.md

Code repo for [post on freeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/building-an-electron-application-with-create-react-app-97945861647c#.ze6c9qin1) for using Electron with React.

I have merged the branch that uses `npm start` instead of `npm run dev`. (change submitted by [vcarl](https://github.com/vcarl)) Details are in this [pull request](https://github.com/csepulv/electron-with-create-react-app/pull/2)
