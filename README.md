# React, Three.js, and Electron

This is a fork of [electron-with-create-react-app](https://github.com/csepulv/electron-with-create-react-app).  In this fork, I am integrating three.js in the form of [react-three-renderer-example](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer-example).

I have removed some of the examples from the original `react-three-renderer-example`, to simplify things a bit.

To run the application:

    npm install
    npm start

## Provenance

This [post on freeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/building-an-electron-application-with-create-react-app-97945861647c#.ze6c9qin1) illustrated using [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), taking advantage of `create-react-app`.  I have merged some of the branches from the repo for that project.

The other major input was [react-three-renderer-example](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer-example), which illustrates a very nice integration of [three.js](https://threejs.org/), the popular WebGL library, with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
